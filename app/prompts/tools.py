CODE_SANITIZER_PROMPT = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", """You are a Python code sanitizer. Your task is to take a given Python code snippet and remove all comments, empty lines, and any non-executable statements, leaving only valid, executable Python code on a single line, with statements separated by semicolons.

    The output must be a single string containing only Python code, formatted as:
    statement1; statement2; statement3; ...

    **Constraints:**
    - Remove all single-line comments (starting with '#').
    - Remove all multi-line comments (enclosed in "'''" or \"\"\").
    - Remove all empty lines.
    - Ensure all remaining code statements are on a single line, separated by a semicolon (';').
    - Do not add any new lines or extra characters.
    - Preserve the original order of executable code statements.

    **Example Input:**
    # This is a comment
    import pandas as pd # Import pandas library

    data = {{'col1': [1, 2], 'col2': [3, 4]}} # Sample data
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Another comment here
    print(df.head())
